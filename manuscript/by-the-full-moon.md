# [By the Full Moon](/nox-apartment)

**An interactive story &ndash; Part of The Game of Souls &ndash; A Beginnings Arc &ndash; By AJ Hunter**

Hi, my name is Nox. This is a little different from the usual story we tell &ndash; AJ and I. In this tale, you get to help me decide what to do.  I might break the fourth wall, and I might ramble off into the sunset as I'm known to do.  Hopefuly you'll stick around and find out exactly how this story ends.

## [nox-apartment]("Nox's Studio Apartment")

I live in a simple studio apartment. It's nothing special, but it's really all I need.  I have a useable [kitchen](/nox-kitchen), a [bathroom](/nox-bathroom) with an awesome shower, my [bed](#nox-bed) is comfortable, and I have a [place to sit](#nox-couch) and relax with [a book](#nox-book) on my limited down time. The one thing you'll notice I don't have is a TV. I never really found them useful &ndash; besides I could never sit still long enough to watch a program or a movie without being forced by my friends to do so.

Everything I own, short of the furniture can fit into two bags &ndash; mostly.  Though I keep most of the hunting gear in the [closet](/nox-closet), and my clothes in the [dresser](/nox-dresser) across from my bed.  I'm a bit of an organizational nut so everything is always in its place.
